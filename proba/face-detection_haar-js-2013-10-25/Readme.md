# HAAR.js 

## Further development on this project has stopped!!


__Feature Detection Library for JavaScript__    (uses HTML5 canvas on browser and Canvas package on Node)

Based on [Viola-Jones Feature Detection Algorithm using Haar Cascades](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~efros/courses/LBMV07/Papers/viola-cvpr-01.pdf)

This is a port of [OpenCV C++ Haar Detection](http://opencv.org/) (actually a port of [JViolaJones](http://code.google.com/p/jviolajones/) which is a port of OpenCV for Java) to JavaScript and Node

###How To use
You can use the __existing openCV cascades__  to build your detectors.

To do this just transform the __opencv xml file__ to *javascript* or *json* format
using the __haartojs__ (php) tool (in cascades folder)

__examples:__

to use opencv's *haarcascades_frontalface_alt.xml*  in *javascript* do:

```bash
haartojs haarcascades_frontalface_alt.xml > haarcascades_frontalface_alt.js
```

this creates a javascript file:   *haarcascades_frontalface_alt.js*
which you can include in your html file or node file

the variable to use in javascript is similarly  
*haarcascades_frontalface_alt*  (both in browser and node)

to transform a cascade xml file to *json* format do:

```bash
haartojson haarcascades_frontalface_alt.xml > haarcascades_frontalface_alt.json
```

The structure of the *.js* and *.json* formats is exactly the same, so you can interchange between the two freely


__IMPORTANT__ : The conversion process has changed from previous versions (both in the CLI script and in HAAR.js)

The changes are :

* the feature rectangle coordinates are stored in an array instead of an object hash
* the tilted flag/attribute for rectangles (Rainer Lienhart et al.) is incorporated in the conversion

so __make sure to re-convert your .js xml cascades__ for this version of HAAR.js

The tilted attribute for rectangles (Rainer Lienhart et al. extension of the algorithm) describes tilted (rotated 45 deg) features (rectangles)
in order to detect more features at rotated positions

The tilted flag is added in the *.js* or *.json* files (as *tilt* ), 
(see also [js-objectdetect](https://github.com/mtschirs/js-objectdetect) , which uses the Lienhart extension of the algorithm)

This is now incorporated into HAAR.js and this increases the compatibility 
with the OpenCV cascades (when they use tilted features, eg mouth cascade)


####Detector Methods

__constructor()__
```javascript
new detector(haardata, Parallel);
```

__Explanation of parameters__

* _haardata_ : The actual haardata (as generated by haartojs tool), this is specific per feature, openCV haar data can be used.
* _Parallel_ : Optional, this is the _Parallel_ object, as returned by the _parallel.js_ script (included). It enables HAAR.js to run parallel computations both in browser and node (can be much faster)

__clearCache()__
```javascript
detector.clearCache();
```

Clear any cached image data and haardata in case space is an issue. Use image method and cascade method (see below) to re-set image and haar data


__cascade()__
```javascript
detector.cascade(haardata);
```

Allow to use same detector (with its cached image data), to detect different feature on same image, by using another cascade. This way any image pre-processing is done only once

__Explanation of parameters__

* _haardata_ : The actual haardata (as generated by haartojs tool), this is specific per feature, openCV haar data can be used.


__image()__
```javascript
detector.image(ImageOrVideoOrCanvas, scale, CanvasClass);
```

__Explanation of parameters__

* _ImageOrVideoOrCanvas_ : an actual Image or Video element or Canvas Object (in this case they are equivalent).
* _scale_ : The percent of scaling from the original image, so detection proceeds faster on a smaller image (default __0.5__ ). __NOTE__ scaling might alter the detection results sometimes, if having problems opt towards 1 (slower)
* _CanvasClass_ : This is optional and used only when running in node (passing the node-canvas object).


__interval()__
```javascript
detector.interval(detectionInterval);
```

__Explanation of parameters__

* _detectionInterval_ : interval to run the detection asynchronously (if not parallel) in  microseconds (default __30__).


__selection()__
```javascript
detector.selection('auto'|object|feature|x [,y, width, height]);
```

Allow to set a custom region in the image to confine the detection process only in that region (eg detect nose while face already detected)

__Explanation of parameters__

* _1st parameter_ : This can be the string 'auto' which sets the whole image as the selection, or an object ie: {x:10, y:'auto', width:100, height:'auto'} (every param set as 'auto' will take the default image value) or a detection rectangle/feature, or a x coordinate (along with rest coordinates).
* _y_ : (Optional) the selection start y coordinate, can be an actual value or 'auto' (y=0)
* _width_ : (Optional) the selection width, can be an actual value or 'auto' (width=image.width)
* _height_ : (Optional) the selection height, can be an actual value or 'auto' (height=image.height)

The actual selection rectangle/feature is available as this.Selection or detector.Selection

__cannyThreshold()__
```javascript
detector.cannyThreshold({low: lowThreshold, high: highThreshold});
```

Set the thresholds when Canny Pruning is used, for extra fine-tuning. 
Canny Pruning detects the number/density of edges in a given region. A region with too few or too many edges is unlikely to be a feature. 
Default values work fine in most cases, however depending on image size and the specific feature, some fine tuning could be needed

__Explanation of parameters__

* _low_ : (Optional) The low threshold (default __20__ ).
* _high_ : (Optional) The high threshold (default __100__ ).


__detect()__
```javascript
detector.detect(baseScale, scale_inc, increment, min_neighbors, doCannyPruning);
```

__Explanation of parameters__ ([JViolaJones Parameters](http://code.google.com/p/jviolajones/wiki/Parameters))

* *baseScale* : The initial ratio between the window size and the Haar classifier size (default __1__ ).
* *scale_inc* : The scale increment of the window size, at each step (default __1.25__ ).
* *increment* : The shift of the window at each sub-step, in terms of percentage of the window size (default __0.5__ ).
* *min_neighbors* : The minimum numbers of similar rectangles needed for the region to be considered as a feature (avoid noise) (default __1__ )
* *doCannyPruning* : enable Canny Pruning to pre-detect regions unlikely to contain features, in order to speed up the execution (optional default __true__ ). 

__HAAR.js works both in the browser and in Node.js (supporting parallel computations with Parallel.js)__


####Runing inside the brower
 Loading wth script tags
    You can run the example face.html or mouth.html inside your browser

####Running inside Node
 For running, the package have a dependency on canvas
 You can find an example inside examples/nodes.js
Valid Output
```bash
node examples/node.js 
processing the picture
[{"x":102.5,"y":105.5,"width":160.66666666666666,"height":160.66666666666666}]
```

To work properly, canvas need some system depencencies.
You can find instruction on https://github.com/LearnBoost/node-canvas/wiki
For example for Ubuntu : 
```bash
sudo apt-get install libcairo2-dev libjpeg8-dev libpango1.0-dev libgif-dev
```

####Loading with RequireJS
 As a third option, you can load the library with requireJS, both on the browser on with node.
There is an example of loading with RequireJS inside node in examples/require.js.
The configuration would be the same inside a browser


####Supporting parallel computation
 The [parallel.js](https://github.com/adambom/parallel.js) library is included in this repository, see the _face.html_ example for how to use.
 In most cases using parallel computation (if supported) can be much faster (eg _eye.html_ example)


###Where to find Haar Cascades xml files to use for feature detection
* [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/)
* [This resource](http://alereimondo.no-ip.org/OpenCV/34)
* search the web :)
* [Train your own](http://docs.opencv.org/doc/user_guide/ug_traincascade.html) with a little extra help [here](http://note.sonots.com/SciSoftware/haartraining.html) and [here](http://coding-robin.de/2013/07/22/train-your-own-opencv-haar-classifier.html)
* A [haarcascade for eyes](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~shameem/haarcascade_eye.html) contributed by [Mar Canet](https://github.com/mcanet) demo [here](/examples/eye.html)



###Usage Ideas
* [SmileDetectJS](https://github.com/roironn/SmileDetectJS)
* [ObjectDetect](https://github.com/mtschirs/js-objectdetect) (some common ideas with HAAR.js are used with extra functionality like object tracking)



###TODO
- [x] optimize detector for real-time usage on browsers (eg. -> https://github.com/liuliu/ccv) [DONE use parallel.js]
- [x] add selection option, detection is confined to that selection (eg detect nose while face already detected) [DONE]
- [x] check if some operations can use fixed-point arithmetic, or other micro-optimizations [DONE where applicable]
- [ ] keep up with the changes in openCV cascades xml format (will try)
- [ ] add some real performance tests (anyone interested??)
